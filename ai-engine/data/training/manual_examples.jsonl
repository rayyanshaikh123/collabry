Here's how it works:\n\n**The Process:**\n1. Plants absorb sunlight through chlorophyll (the green pigment in leaves)\n2. They take in carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air through tiny pores called stomata\n3. They absorb water (H₂O) from the soil through their roots\n\n**The Reaction:**\n6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂\n\n**The Result:**\n- Plants produce glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) for energy\n- They release oxygen (O₂) as a byproduct, which we breathe!\n\nThis happens in two stages: light reactions (in thylakoids) and dark reactions/Calvin cycle (in stroma). Pretty amazing, right?"}]}
